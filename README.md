A keyboard-first terminal file manager and embedded editor for developers —
Norton Commander workflow, modern TUI, written in Rust.

---

## Features

### File management
- Dual-pane browser with side-by-side and stacked layouts
- Create, copy, move, rename, and delete files and directories
- Collision resolution dialog (skip, overwrite, rename)
- Background workers — file operations, directory scans, and previews never block each other
- Mark multiple files for batch operations
- Hidden file toggle, sort by name / size / extension / modified date
- Navigate history (Alt+Left / Alt+Right)

### Editor
- Embedded text editor with syntax highlighting (via syntect)
- Undo / redo with delta-based history (O(log n), handles large files)
- In-editor search with match count and wrap-around
- Save / discard flow with dirty-state guard

### Markdown live preview
- When editing a `.md` file the tools panel splits vertically — editor on the left, rendered preview on the right
- Native ratatui 0.29 renderer: headings, bold, italic, inline code, fenced blocks, bullets, ordered lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules
- Preview updates on every keystroke — no background job, zero latency

### Preview panel
- Syntax-highlighted file preview for source files (F3)
- Markdown files rendered as formatted text
- Binary file detection with size display

### Git integration
- Per-file status indicators in both panes (`M` modified, `A` added, `?` untracked, `D` deleted, `R` renamed, `U` conflicted)
- Current branch name in the status bar
- Refreshes automatically alongside every directory scan
- No git crate dependency — shells out to `git` on PATH; absent or non-repo paths are silently skipped

### Navigation & UX
- Menu bar with File, Navigate, View, Help menus (keyboard mnemonics + mouse click)
- Command palette (`Ctrl+P`)
- In-app settings panel for theme, icon mode, layout, and preview preferences (`Ctrl+O`)
- Full mouse support: click to focus panes, scroll to navigate, click menu items, hover highlights
- Three built-in themes: Oxide (default), Fjord, Sandbar
- Unicode icons by default, ASCII fallback, custom icon font mode

## Tech stack

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `crossterm 0.28` | Terminal I/O, raw mode, mouse capture |
| `ratatui 0.29` | Rendering and layout |
| `ropey 1.6` | O(log n) editor buffer |
| `syntect 5.3` | Syntax highlighting |
| `crossbeam-channel 0.5` | Background worker messaging |
| `serde` + `toml` | Config serialisation |
| `thiserror` | Typed error handling |

## Architecture

```
App (event loop)
├── AppState (single source of truth)
│   ├── PaneSetState    — dual-pane navigation and selection
│   ├── EditorState     — editor buffer + search + preview state
│   ├── PreviewState    — preview panel content and scroll
│   ├── OverlayState    — menus, prompts, dialogs, palette
│   └── git: [RepoStatus; 2]  — per-pane git status cache
├── WorkerChannels (four dedicated background threads)
│   ├── ScanWorker      — directory listing
│   ├── FileOpWorker    — copy / move / delete / rename
│   ├── PreviewWorker   — file content + syntax highlighting
│   └── GitWorker       — git status + branch detection
└── FocusLayer          — compiler-enforced input routing
    (Pane | Editor | Preview | MarkdownPreview | Modal(…))
```

Key design decisions:
- One UI thread + four bounded worker threads. No async runtime.
- `FocusLayer` enum makes illegal input-routing states unrepresentable.
- Editor uses `ropey::Rope` (B-tree) for O(log n) insert/delete on large files.
- Highlight cache keyed by `edit_version` — syntect runs once per edit, not per frame.
- Git status is a fire-and-forget background job triggered alongside every scan.

## Project layout

```
src/
  app.rs              — event loop, command dispatch, mouse routing
  state/              — AppState and all sub-states
  ui/                 — rendering modules (pane, editor, preview, markdown, …)
  editor.rs           — EditorBuffer (ropey backend, delta undo)
  jobs.rs             — WorkerChannels, four background workers
  git.rs              — RepoStatus, parse_porcelain, detect_repo
  fs.rs               — filesystem operations
  highlight.rs        — syntect wrapper
  action.rs           — Action enum, FocusLayer-aware key routing
  config.rs           — AppConfig, ThemePalette, keymaps

## Running locally

```bash
cargo run --
```

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --release
```

---

## Configuration

Config is loaded from (in order of preference):

1. `ZETA_CONFIG` environment variable path
2. `%APPDATA%\zeta\config.toml` (Windows)
3. `~/.config/zeta/config.toml` (Linux/macOS)

```toml
# Theme: "matrix" (default) | "norton" | "fjord" | "sandbar" | "oxide"
theme = "matrix"

# Icon mode: "unicode" (default) | "ascii" | "custom"
# For "custom", install assets/fonts/zeta-icons.ttf in your terminal first.
icon_mode = "unicode"

# Open preview panel on startup
preview_panel_open = false

# Auto-preview on cursor move
preview_on_selection = true
```

Access settings at runtime with `Ctrl+O` or via the View menu.

## Roadmap

See [`docs/superpowers/plans/ROADMAP.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/ROADMAP.md) for the full wave-by-wave development plan.

Upcoming highlights:
- **Wave 4C** — full-window editor mode, markdown preview scroll sync, preview focus/toggle
- **Wave 4D** — in-pane quick filter (`/`), `Ctrl+P` fuzzy file find
- **Wave 5A** — Find & Replace in editor, directory auto-refresh watcher
- **Wave 5B** — bookmarks (persisted), trash/recycle bin (recoverable delete)
- **Wave 5C** — shell drop-in (`F2` opens shell in current directory)
- **Wave 6A/6B** — archive browsing, directory diff mode
- **Wave 7A** — SSH/SFTP remote filesystems
